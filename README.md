# Paper Wallet

Paper Wallet is the safest way to store your seed phrase and private keys. Our solution allows to split your seed phrase into several pages which you can print out and keep separately. We recommend locking the pages in separate safe deposit boxes in different locations. Paper Wallet supports redundant encryption algorithms, thus, letting you set not only the number of pages to store the seed on, but also the number of pages required to recover the seed.
